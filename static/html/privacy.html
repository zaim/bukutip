			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
				Your privacy is very important to BukuTip. Here's the gist:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly
				need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like
				your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
				<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone
				except to comply with the law, develop our products, or
				protect our rights.</li>
				<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless
				required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
			</ul>
			<div id="terms">
				<p class="cc">
					<img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png"/>
					(Note, this Privacy Policy is based on one developed for
					<a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> and is
					available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/">
					Creative Commons Sharealike license</a>, which means
					you're more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for
					your own use, just make sure to replace references to us
					with ones to you, and if you want we'd appreciate a link to
					BukuTip somewhere on your site.)
				</p>
				<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
				<p>
					Like most website operators, BukuTip collects
					non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
					web browsers and servers typically make available, such as
					the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
					the date and time of each visitor request. BukuTip's
					purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
					information is to better understand how BukuTip's visitors
					use its website. From time to time, BukuTip may release
					non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
					e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
					website.
				</p>
				<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
				<p>
					BukuTip may collect statistics about the behavior of
					visitors to its websites. For instance, BukuTip may
					monitor the most popular book searches on the Website.
					BukuTip may display this information publicly or provide
					it to others. However, BukuTip does not disclose
					personally-identifying information other than as described
					below.
				</p>
				<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
				<p>
					BukuTip discloses potentially personally-identifying and
					personally-identifying information only to those of its
					employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i)
					need to know that information in order to process it on
					BukuTip's behalf or to provide services available at BukuTip's
					websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
					others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
					organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
					using BukuTip, you consent to the transfer of such information
					to them. BukuTip will not rent or sell potentially
					personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
					to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
					affiliated organizations, as described above, BukuTip
					discloses potentially personally-identifying and
					personally-identifying information only when required to do so
					by law, or when BukuTip believes in good faith that disclosure
					is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights o
					BukuTip, third parties or the public at large. If you send us
					a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
					feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
					order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
					us support other users. BukuTip takes all measures reasonably
					necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
					alteration or destruction of potentially
					personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
				</p>
				<h2>Cookies</h2>
				<p>
					A cookie is a string of information that a website stores
					on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
					provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
					BukuTip uses cookies to help BukuTip identify and track
					visitors, their usage of BukuTip, and their website access
					preferences. BukuTip visitors who do not wish to have
					cookies placed on their computers should set their
					browsers to refuse cookies before using BukuTip, with the
					drawback that certain features of BukuTip may not function
					properly without the aid of cookies.
				</p>
				<h2>Ads</h2>
				<p>
					Ads appearing on any of our pages may be delivered to
					users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
					cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
					each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
					information about you or others who use your computer.
					This information allows ad networks to, among other
					things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
					will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy
					covers the use of cookies by BukuTip and does not cover
					the use of cookies by any advertisers.
				</p>
				<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
				<p>
					Although most changes are likely to be minor, BukuTip may
					change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
					BukuTip's sole discretion. BukuTip encourages visitors to
					frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
					Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change
					in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
					such change.
